set up TLB(4)

//references are decimal in the input file
//each ref is 16 bits/2 bytes
//1 B vpn, 1 B offset
0 - 65,535

num_refers = 0;
num_hits = 0;

for ref in references:
    //determine the vpn
    num_refers = 1
    vpn = ref >> 8          //shifting 8 bits
    offset = ref & 0xff     //mask it and only keep the right mask side, bit mask 
    //in the tlb?
    if vpn in tlb:
        num_hits = 1
        //update tlb data as needed 
    else:
        //see if there's an empty spot
        //usually there's not
        //apply replacement polict to select and evict/replace an entry

to check if TLB is being filled correctly and to test hit, just put the same value in over and over
